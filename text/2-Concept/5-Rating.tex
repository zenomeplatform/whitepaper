\section{Rating system}
The platform will create rating for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Separately for each genetic fragment or block of personal data
\item Organizations
\item Service providers
\item Data providers (such as DNA sequencing labs)
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
There will be no individual user rating, since it actually represents the sum of his or her genetic fragment ratings, which is not available to public. If the genetic data was uploaded using Organization account, then the initial rating will be automatically increased by the organization's rating.
\end{note}

The factors affecting the rating of the genetic fragments
\begin{description}

  \item [Confirmation from the laboratory]
    increases the rating of uploaded data in proportion to the rating of the lab in which they have been obtained. Confirmation may represent a digital signature of the laboratory, or data uploading by the laboratory itself upon client's request.

  \item [Check for plausibility]
    Allows to check user genetic information using pre-defined statistical models of polymorphism frequencies and genetic linkage. This module is under development.

  \item [Participation in research]
    The rating increases with the number of successful researches involving the fragment. If the result of the information investigation have been considered implausible, the rating decreases.
