\section{Main distributed subsystems of the platform}
The platform has the following organization levels:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic System Layer (Critical Infrastructure)
  \item Data Storage and Processing Level
  \item High-Level Interactions
\end{itemize}

The following subsystems are included within the platform:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Basic System Layer
  \begin{description}
    \item[Low-Level Interoperation]
      Basic subsystem of message exchange between network nodes.
      It also enables creation of distributed hash tables.
    \item[Authorizations]
      The infrastructure of accounts and access management to private information.
  \end{description}

  \item Data Storage and Processing Level
  \begin{description}
    \item[Storages]
      Abstraction level for access to distributed file system.
    \item[Processing]
      Infrastructure for Ð° distributed calculations.
  \end{description}

  \item High-Level Interactions
  \begin{description}
    \item[Secure queries]
      A subsystem that enables formation of the offers for buying genomic data which could be shown to appropriate users only.
    \item[Open data operations]
      Provides tools for operation with open (not private) data.
    \item[External Services Platform]
      Provides API for connecting external centrally managed services to the platform. Arranges secure data transfer using conventional web protocols.
  \end{description}

\end{enumerate}
